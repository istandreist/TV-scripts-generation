# TV-scripts-generation
Learn from a Seinfeld show script and generate a new script, using LSTM.

This is the third project from Udacity's Deep Learning Course, where we use LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) type of neural network to generate new TV scripts from an example of a Seinfeld script.

The generated script is in the generated_script_1.txt file.

The main file is the dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb Jupyter Notebook file.
